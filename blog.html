            <p class="bushead black"> Kenna Clifford weaves a carefully crafted world of poetic lullabies that suit a perfect read before winding down for the evening. Kenna’s blog begins with a center aligned image that draws all the attention. A work by Japanese artist, ‘Akira Nagasawa’, this painting help sets the atmosphere that Kenna crafts through her writing tone. Nagasawa graduated from Tokyo National University of Fine Art and Music, completed an M.F.A. at Tokyo National University of Fine Art and Music, and is now an assistant Professor of Tohoku University of Art & Design. In Nagasawa’s painting, a wolf or dog is depicted in shades of autumn that call back to the cozy atmosphere Kenna seeks to create. Atop the wolf is a constellation of stars, a pattern that gives the painting a cosmic vibe of wonder and dreaming. Nagasawa is a talented artist with solo exhibitions running annually from 1994 - 2004. I hope to see more of Nagasawas work in Kenna’s blog - as I am a fan of how Nagasawa’s visual aesthetic and Kennas written tone intersect!
            
                <br><br>
                On the home page, Kenna introduces her site with vivid and imaginative language. The tone that Kenna sets is a comforting yet mysterious mood. By crafting this tone, Kenna is personifying her voice as a character that readers can identify with. In Kenna’s first lullaby, she carefully imagines a world of wonder and magic while describing a moment in time for the natural world as winter sets in. Particularly, Kenna discusses the common fruit fly, ‘Drosophila melanogaster’. The way that Kenna approaches her questions about the fruit flies relationship with winter and human domains continues to develop her character as a writer in a very similar fashion to how she wrote her introduction. Kenna is certainly breaking ground fast for a well-developed and truly personified online self.
            <br><br>
            In Kenna’s ‘about’ section, she describes herself as a writer, filmmaker, and poet. The theme of her blog is well-chosen to suit her strengths and passions in life! This is always a good choice for an online blog, as it is easy to create an authentic online persona if you are speaking from your talents - and from the heart. In an image depicting Kenna, her eyes are closed. This is potentially to further drive home the thematic element of bedtime and dreaming. The image of Kenna also shows her holding a bowl of mysterious contents. While likely unintentional, aspects like this still help create the wondrous and mysterious world that Kenna seeks to craft.</p>

            <p class="bushead whiteType">Hello readers! Today we discuss you. Moda Online Blog is a site for commentary and coverage of haute coture and designed products. Our readers are a diverse and creative set of people who expect high quality. The audience for the blog will largely be comprised of men and women from the lower main-land of British Columbia with design and fashion interests between the ages of 15 - 65. I leveraged large typography to promote accessibility and allow older readers to find ease in reading each post. I also sought to maintain clear hiearchy and simple clusters to convey clear information hierarchy. It didn’t take much thinking to make the editorial decision to keep the blog’s tone casual. To help personify my digital identity and aid my presentation of self online, I have kept the tone of writing more casual.</p>

            <h5 class="bushead whiteType">Week 3: Superhero Guest Post - Goku responds to Craig Mod about “How I Got My Attention Back”.</h5>
            <p class="bushead whiteType">“Hi! My name is Son Goku. I want to discuss an online article today. How I Got My Attention Back”, is a blog article by Craig Mod that sees the author endulging in a camp for artists offered by Virginia Center for Creative Arts for 30 days. Historically, ‘artist colonies’ are for privilidged white people who alchohol, affairs, and a hipster or hedonistic style of life. Craig agknowledges his privilidge in being able to attend the camp, describing the nature of this action as apostasy or paganism. Yet, Craig revels in his privilidge to do so.
<br><br>
                Craig Mod mistakes a cushy 30 day vacation for a onerous and life affecting period of self challenge and improvement. We are all easily able to quit addictions without harmful withdrawls for 30 days on a vacation. Just as easily, we will pick our habits back up after the end of the 30 day vacation and continue as if the context of our life had never changed. The truth is, Craig only vacationed for a brief period - despite 30 days being almost too long to even call a vacation. 
                <br><br>
                I hoped to find insight in the rules Craig Mod set for himself after his 30 day offline excursion. Unfortunately, his rules dont help my scenario. Craigs first rule states “The internet goes off before bed”. Unlike Craig, I do not spend time scrolling on my phone in bed. I stay in my living room until 3am and then get in bed and fall asleep. Craigs second rule states “The internet doesn’t return until after lunch.”. Craig spends time on his phone in the morning. I sleep until noon.
                <br><br>
                Conversely to Craig Mod, I highly appreciate giving my attention to my phone and other online devices. Craig seeks to be in control of his attention, while misunderstanding that appreciating human media, arts, comedy, people, culture, and fashion are perfectly good ways to spend attention. Clash of Clans however is entirely undeserving of any attention unless you are a farmer in Myanmar without access to personal computer gaming. Thats all - Son Goku out!</p>

          <h5 class="bushead black">Week One: What constitutes a stranger?</h5>
          <h5 class="bushead black"></h5>
         <p class="bushead black"> I consider a person known when I have had a handful of interactions with them. Often I know who people are though social media without having ever spoken to them. Often I know very much about people without ever having seen them! This is due to social media reccomending me people to follow, or showcasing accounts of local people who follow similar pages as me. To me, a person can be a stranger depending on context. Any random person who I have never seen or heard of is certainly a stranger. An aquaintance may also be a stranger to me if they are in a more personal setting. I will typically address an aquaintance somewhat more casually than a stranger. The intination and pitch of my voice may also be lower or higher depending on how I want to convey myself to the stranger. For example, if the stranger is an employer, someone elderly, or someone young, I will speak softer and choose my phrasing carefully. <br><br>If I were to meet a friend who I knew online in person, I would initially retain my careful selection of phrasing. Being the stranger is an ‘emotionally risky’ endevour. In a situation where I am the stranger, it takes repeated interaction over a longer period of time before I feel that I know indivuduals.</p>
      
         <h5 class="bushead">Week One: Meeting a Stranger.</h5>
         <h5 class="bushead"></h5>
        <p class="bushead">This week I spoke with a stranger. I was practicing my recreational hobby - skateboarding at a park on commercial drive. This time, I visited a park that I do not typically frequent. I consider a person known when I have had a handful of interactions with them. When the stranger arrived at the park, we exchanged a nod. After a brief period of time, I crossed the threshold and asked a question. James Hamblin observes that 
<br><br>
            “When it comes to knowing people, that line is still often drawn at whether you’ve spoken to a person before...A significant threshold to be crossed with a simple act” .
            <br>
            <br>
            Hamblin’s musing was correct in this case. When I returned to the park on subsequent days, I continued to meet and talk with the stranger. I have now met them three times, and we exchanged names. Often, the skatepark is ripe with civil inattention. Due to the smaller sizer of this park and fewer number of people, it was easier to speak to a stranger. The encounter was very different from my online interactions, as I am a heavy emoji user. There were also periodic breaks as we exercised.</p>
