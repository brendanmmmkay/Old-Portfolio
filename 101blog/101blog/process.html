        <h5 class="bushead black">Process Post: Data Trails and Analytics</h5>
       <p class="bushead black"> Analytics describes the systematic computational analysis of data or statistics. Leveraging data analysis, analytics can be used to communicate discoveries and meaningful interpretations of data. Often, analytics are modeled in graphic form to help visual comprehension of complex numbers or abstract equations and results. In the growing age of digital media, analytics provide content creators with a high level of social media based capital and literacy the powers to look into their audience’s patterns, demographics, and behaviours. Google Analytics is a strong platform offered by the search engine giant to help online creators make better businesses and stronger communities. Ultimately, the tool helps both parties if leveraged correctly. Unfortunately, web analytics across Google, YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter can all share the telling signs of how far our data trails reach. The internet is now a critically important global communications system, and its vastness is challenged by the ease and speed at which the world wide web can be browsed. In developing appropriate engagement strategies to leverage digital audiences, creators become aware of their global viewership. A data analyst may also use tools including Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, SQL, Tableau R, or Python, SAS, Microsoft Power BI, Jupyter, or Notebooks to interpret and visually represent data. A strong data analyst will approach their audience as subsets of clients. They will identify their pain points, frustrations, needs, and aspirational goals to understand what kind of content supports their audience best. There are also four kinds of analytics in business, that each pose a different question. Descriptive Analytics ask, ‘What’s happening to my business right now?’. Online, descriptive analytics tell insights about current user practices and behaviours. Diagnostic Analytics ask, ‘Why is it happening?’. This is a query into the cause and effect relationship between descriptive analytics and real world results. Predictive Analytics ask ‘What’s likely to happen in the future?’. By creating statistical models and visual representations, predictive analytics can forecast what may happen in the future. Lastly, Prescriptive Analytics asks, ‘What do I need to do to succeed?’. The most important piece of the puzzle - prescriptive analytics focus on what steps can be taken to improve the online media business. Leveraging these four paths of data analytics, online creators are supported by a powerful tool of insight and information. 
        <br>
        Personally, I am unconcerned with data trails. If I wanted to mask my internet presence best, I would use The Onion Browser, ‘Tor’. Tor allows users to establish anonymoous connection to the internet through a free volunteed overlay network. The network consists of over seven thousand relays to conceal a users location and usage from any host performing network surveillance or traffic analysis. Another option is a web browser called ‘Duck Duck Go’, or ‘DDG’. DDG is a web browser that avoids the filter bubble of personalized search results. Both of these tools are great options for concealing data trails on the web, however I do not use them for I am unconcerned with data trails and I perfer the convenience of personalized search results.

        <h5 class="bushead whiteType">Week 3: Process, responding to Craig Mod about “How I Got My Attention Back”.</h5>
        <p class="bushead whiteType">“How I Got My Attention Back”, is a blog article by Craig Mod that sees the author endulging in a camp for artists offered by Virginia Center for Creative Arts for 30 days. Historically, ‘artist colonies’ are for privilidged white people who alchohol, affairs, and a hipster or hedonistic style of life. Craig agknowledges his privilidge in being able to attend the camp, describing the nature of this action as apostasy or paganism. Yet, Craig revels in his privilidge to do so.
<br><br>
            Craig Mod mistakes a cushy 30 day vacation for a onerous and life affecting period of self challenge and improvement. We are all easily able to quit addictions without harmful withdrawls for 30 days on a vacation. Just as easily, we will pick our habits back up after the end of the 30 day vacation and continue as if the context of our life had never changed. The truth is, Craig only vacationed for a brief period - despite 30 days being almost too long to even call a vacation. 
            <br><br>
            I hoped to find insight in the rules Craig Mod set for himself after his 30 day offline excursion. Unfortunately, his rules dont help my scenario. Craigs first rule states “The internet goes off before bed”. Unlike Craig, I do not spend time scrolling on my phone in bed. I stay in my living room until 3am and then get in bed and fall asleep. Craigs second rule states “The internet doesn’t return until after lunch.”. Craig spends time on his phone in the morning. I sleep until noon.
            <br><br>
            Conversely to Craig Mod, I highly appreciate giving my attention to my phone and other online devices. Craig seeks to be in control of his attention, while misunderstanding that appreciating human media, arts, comedy, people, culture, and fashion are perfectly good ways to spend attention. Clash of Clans however is entirely undeserving of any attention unless you are a farmer in Myanmar without access to personal computer gaming.</p>

            <p class="bushead whiteType">Hello readers! Today we discuss you. Moda Online Blog is a site for commentary and coverage of haute coture and designed products. Our readers are a diverse and creative set of people who expect high quality. The audience for the blog will largely be comprised of men and women from the lower main-land of British Columbia with design and fashion interests between the ages of 15 - 65. I leveraged large typography to promote accessibility and allow older readers to find ease in reading each post. I also sought to maintain clear hiearchy and simple clusters to convey clear information hierarchy. It didn’t take much thinking to make the editorial decision to keep the blog’s tone casual. To help personify my digital identity and aid my presentation of self online, I have kept the tone of writing more casual.</p>

          <h5 class="bushead whiteType">Week Two: Installation & Setup.</h5>
          <p class="bushead whiteType">To host this blog, I took an alternate approach from wordpress. Instead, I decided to code the site myself and host it on github pages. Github Pages is a free webhosting platform that provides all the powerful features of the GitHub software. I began by drafting up an HTML index file with a loose content hierarchy structure with the general scope of assingments in mind.</p>

          <h5 class="bushead black">Week One: What constitutes a stranger?</h5>
          <h5 class="bushead black"></h5>
         <p class="bushead black"> I consider a person known when I have had a handful of interactions with them. Often I know who people are though social media without having ever spoken to them. Often I know very much about people without ever having seen them! This is due to social media reccomending me people to follow, or showcasing accounts of local people who follow similar pages as me. To me, a person can be a stranger depending on context. Any random person who I have never seen or heard of is certainly a stranger. An aquaintance may also be a stranger to me if they are in a more personal setting. I will typically address an aquaintance somewhat more casually than a stranger. The intination and pitch of my voice may also be lower or higher depending on how I want to convey myself to the stranger. For example, if the stranger is an employer, someone elderly, or someone young, I will speak softer and choose my phrasing carefully. <br><br>If I were to meet a friend who I knew online in person, I would initially retain my careful selection of phrasing. Being the stranger is an ‘emotionally risky’ endevour. In a situation where I am the stranger, it takes repeated interaction over a longer period of time before I feel that I know indivuduals.</p>
      
         <p class="datebushead black">September 5 2022</p>
         <h5 class="bushead black">Week One: Meeting a Stranger.</h5>
         <h5 class="bushead black"></h5>
        <p class="bushead black">This week I spoke with a stranger. I was practicing my recreational hobby - skateboarding at a park on commercial drive. This time, I visited a park that I do not typically frequent. I consider a person known when I have had a handful of interactions with them. When the stranger arrived at the park, we exchanged a nod. After a brief period of time, I crossed the threshold and asked a question. James Hamblin observes that 
  <br><br>
            “When it comes to knowing people, that line is still often drawn at whether you’ve spoken to a person before...A significant threshold to be crossed with a simple act” .
            <br>
            <br>
            Hamblin’s musing was correct in this case. When I returned to the park on subsequent days, I continued to meet and talk with the stranger. I have now met them three times, and we exchanged names. Often, the skatepark is ripe with civil inattention. Due to the smaller sizer of this park and fewer number of people, it was easier to speak to a stranger. The encounter was very different from my online interactions, as I am a heavy emoji user. There were also periodic breaks as we exercised.</p>
