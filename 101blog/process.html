        <h5 class="bushead black">Week 12 Process Post: Community Guidelines</h5>
       <p class="bushead black"> While Moda Blog does not feature any opportunities for our audience to interact with us on the website, Moda does have a social media platform where readers can ask questions, discuss a range of topics, and stay up to date on Moda Blog. The fashion world has often generated political discourse, commonly due to its connections with celebrities and stars who wear the clothing and thus represent the fashion houses in the public eye. While fashion is rarely known for sparking controversy, controversy can be leveraged by brands to generate more buzz in anticipation of upcoming ready to wear collections. Recently, Balenciaga has sparked national controversy in their partnership with American hip hop producer and recording artist, Kanye West. Denma Gvasalia, the co-founder of fashion house Vetements is known for seeking controversy. Unfortunately Balenciaga has recently made news for a truly terrible circumstance. The Balenciaga creative director Demna has issued a public apology for one of the fashion brand's recent advertising campaigns, which featured images of young children cuddling teddy bears in fetish clothing. It is being sold with a belt to tie around its neck. Moda Blog will cover such topics on social media. In a future where the Moda Blog twitter has a large following, moderation and community guidelines would be necessary to cover topics like this.
        <br>
        <br>
        Never read the comments is a sentiment that stems from the nature of people’s comments when aided by online anonymity. While Twitter requires phone numbers and accounts to reply to tweets, this does little to prevent trolls. Online anonymity is a hot topic in the digital age. The internet has given people the ability to communicate with others without revealing their identity. However, this also means that people can say whatever they want without any consequences, which has led to an increase in online trolling and abuse. When people are anonymous and they don't have to face any consequences for their actions, they are more likely to say what they want without caring about how it might affect others. The community guidelines help define the tone and voice of the blog in order to maintain consistency. Some blogs may have very strict guidelines, while others are more lenient with their guidelines for content. Moda Blog is dedicated to covering all media content in haute couture and design. This means that adult content including nudity and profanity will be present on our feed and blog. Moda Blog will not have content warnings on the website because all media displayed is considered artistic and educational. On Twitter, content that features nudity may be detected by Twitter bots and given a content warning filter. Moda Blog aims to create content for a young adult audience. On Twitter, Moda Blog will rely on auto moderation to flag and remove content.

        <h5 class="bushead whiteType">Week 11 Process Post: Transmedia Integration.</h5>
        <p class="bushead whiteType">
          Transmedia integration is a great principle in online publishing right now. Transmedia integration is a great way to get more eyes on your content and reach a wider audience.  In a nutshell, transmedia integration is the process of distributing your content across multiple channels. This could include your website, social media, email, and even offline channels like print or TV. The key is to create a cohesive story that can be broken up into different pieces and delivered across all of these channels. When done correctly, transmedia integration can be a powerful tool for growing your audience and reach. As online publications continue to grow in popularity, it's important to consider how to best integrate transmedia content. Transmedia integration can take many forms, but it essentially means creating a cohesive story across multiple channels. This can be done by using the same characters and plot lines across different platforms, or by creating different content for each platform that all ties back to the same story. Done correctly, transmedia integration can create a richer, more immersive experience for readers. It can also help to reach a wider audience by making content available on multiple platforms. 
       <br>
       <br>
       For Moda, transmedia integration is manifested through social media and print materials. The reporting and storytelling on Moda Blog transcends the online blog and shifts in tone & audience on social media. On the official Moda Twitter, behind the scenes content and alternate takes are shared. Behind the scenes content is leveraged to extend the storytelling and broaden the world and online persona of the Moda brand.
       <br>
       <br>
       To get people interested in starting the story, Moda will be collaborating with fashion companies to release merchandise that markets the Moda brand. In this example, a Moda Online Blog hand bag sees Moda diving into soft goods including fabric and leather mediums. Moda will also have print material that celebrates the Moda blog content through story re-telling and continued discourse. Print materials will include mini magazines (zines), posters, and tapestry.

        <h5 class="bushead black">Week 10 Process Post: Data Trails and Analytics</h5>
       <p class="bushead black"> Analytics describes the systematic computational analysis of data or statistics. Leveraging data analysis, analytics can be used to communicate discoveries and meaningful interpretations of data. Often, analytics are modeled in graphic form to help visual comprehension of complex numbers or abstract equations and results. In the growing age of digital media, analytics provide content creators with a high level of social media based capital and literacy the powers to look into their audience’s patterns, demographics, and behaviours. Google Analytics is a strong platform offered by the search engine giant to help online creators make better businesses and stronger communities. Ultimately, the tool helps both parties if leveraged correctly. Unfortunately, web analytics across Google, YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter can all share the telling signs of how far our data trails reach. The internet is now a critically important global communications system, and its vastness is challenged by the ease and speed at which the world wide web can be browsed. In developing appropriate engagement strategies to leverage digital audiences, creators become aware of their global viewership. A data analyst may also use tools including Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, SQL, Tableau R, or Python, SAS, Microsoft Power BI, Jupyter, or Notebooks to interpret and visually represent data. A strong data analyst will approach their audience as subsets of clients. They will identify their pain points, frustrations, needs, and aspirational goals to understand what kind of content supports their audience best. There are also four kinds of analytics in business, that each pose a different question. Descriptive Analytics ask, ‘What’s happening to my business right now?’. Online, descriptive analytics tell insights about current user practices and behaviours. Diagnostic Analytics ask, ‘Why is it happening?’. This is a query into the cause and effect relationship between descriptive analytics and real world results. Predictive Analytics ask ‘What’s likely to happen in the future?’. By creating statistical models and visual representations, predictive analytics can forecast what may happen in the future. Lastly, Prescriptive Analytics asks, ‘What do I need to do to succeed?’. The most important piece of the puzzle - prescriptive analytics focus on what steps can be taken to improve the online media business. Leveraging these four paths of data analytics, online creators are supported by a powerful tool of insight and information. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Personally, I am unconcerned with data trails. If I wanted to mask my internet presence best, I would use The Onion Browser, ‘Tor’. Tor allows users to establish anonymoous connection to the internet through a free volunteed overlay network. The network consists of over seven thousand relays to conceal a users location and usage from any host performing network surveillance or traffic analysis. Another option is a web browser called ‘Duck Duck Go’, or ‘DDG’. DDG is a web browser that avoids the filter bubble of personalized search results. Both of these tools are great options for concealing data trails on the web, however I do not use them for I am unconcerned with data trails and I perfer the convenience of personalized search results.

        <h5 class="bushead black">Week 9 Process Post: Who your audience really is.</h5>
       <p class="bushead black"> The modern internet is a mass of overlapping audiences and niches that breaks the old model of the ‘mass media’ broadcast paradigm. The role of editors as content gatekeepers has drastically changed as any person is easily able to create their own communities online and publish original content toward any community the please. Through social media or online blog keeping, the general public is empowered by the internet to create content in many market channels while consumers are empowered to bridge niches and audiences. Online communication is more collaborative and participatory than print media ever was due to comment sections and social media. When it comes to business, the terms "audience" and "market" are often used interchangeably, however, there is a big distinction between the two. An audience is the group of people who consume your content. A market, on the other hand, is the group of people who are potential customers for your product or service. It's important to understand the difference between audiences and markets because content and marketing strategies need to be different for each. When you're creating content, you need to think about what your audience wants to see. What type of content will they engage with? On the other hand, when you're marketing your product or service, you need to think about what your market needs. What is your persona looking for? What are their goals, frictions, and needs? How can you solve their problem through the content and media you provide? <br>
        <br>
        It is not uncommon for companies to have different perceptions of their online audience than what is actually the case. This discrepancy can happen for a variety of reasons, such as biased self-reporting or outdated data. Whatever the cause, it is important to be aware of this potential discrepancy so that a blog can adjust its marketing strategy accordingly. There are a few ways to get an accurate picture of your online audience. One way is to use data from social media platforms. Another is to use data from your website's analytics. Google Analytics is a great tool that By looking at this data, you can get a better idea of who your online audience actually is and what they are interested in. Analytics provides crucial data for business strategy to ensure that you are problem solving for the right people who actually need your particular solution. It is also important to keep in mind that your online audience can change over time. As your business grows and changes, so too will your audience. This is why it is important to regularly check analytics to understand how your audience channels evolve or diminish as your content changes or stagnates.

        <h5 class="bushead whiteType">Week 8 Process Post: What shapes your experience of a text?</h5>
        <p class="bushead whiteType">Intellectual property (IP) is a legal term that refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions, literary and artistic works, designs, and symbols, names, and images used in commerce. In the digital age, intellectual property has become increasingly important, as more and more content is created and shared online. This has led to some challenges in terms of protecting IP, as it can be difficult to control who has access to digital content. At the same time, the digital age has also shifted our understanding of intellectual property in favor of openness. Creative Commons is a nonprofit organization that provides free and open licenses for creative works, which allow others to use and build upon those works. This has made it easier for people to share and use creative works, and has led to a more open and collaborative culture.
          <br>
       <br>
       As digital technology has made it easier to access and share content, the lines between copyright and infringement have become blurred. With the click of a button, we can now share and remix content without permission from the copyright holder. This has led to a debate about what constitutes infringement and whether copyright law needs to be updated to reflect the changing landscape.
       <br>
       <br>
       A macaque monkey who took a now-famous selfie will not be able to claim copyright to the photo, a U.S. federal judge has ruled. The image in question was taken in 2011 by British photographer David Slater while he was on a trip to Indonesia. The selfie was taken using Slater's camera, and he later published it in a book. However, in 2015, animal rights group PETA filed a lawsuit on behalf of the monkey, claiming that it should own the copyright to the photo. PETA argued that the monkey should be considered the author of the photo because it took the selfie without any input from Slater. In his ruling, Judge William Orrick said that while Congress and the courts have recognized that animals can have legal rights, they have also been clear that animals cannot own copyrights.
       <br>
       <br>
       On one side of the debate, there are those who believe that copyright law is outdated and that it stifles creativity and innovation. They argue that the current system does not allow for the fair use of copyrighted material and that it does not take into account the ways in which content is now shared and used. On the other side, there are those who believe that copyright law is still relevant and that it provides the necessary protection for creators and businesses. They argue that the current system strikes a balance between the rights of copyright. I believe that our current system is dated, however it is extremely important to credit authors. In this new digital age, I believe that leveraging intrinsic information like media meta-data as a sort of receipt or price tag attached to any piece of new media could help accredit original authors and tell the tale of how any singular piece of media has changed over time and traveled across the web.

        <h5 class="bushead black">Week 7 Process Post: Digital Media Democratization</h5>
       <p class="bushead black"> In recent years, we've seen a marked increase in the number of people using digital media to share their thoughts and ideas with the world. This rise in digital media has allowed for a more diverse range of voices to be heard. No longer are we limited to the traditional mass media outlets - anyone with an internet connection can now share their thoughts with the world. Digital media has revolutionized the way we communicate and consume information. But along with the many benefits of this new technology comes the potential for abuse. We have all seen the potential for digital media to be used for evil. In recent years, we have seen examples of people using social media to spread lies and misinformation. We have seen people use digital media to harass and bully others. And we have seen people use digital media to commit acts of digital assassination, where they try to destroy someone's reputation online.
        <br>
        <br>
        While there are many positive aspects of digital media, we need to be aware of the potential for abuse and digital assassination. We need to be careful about the information we consume and share online. And we need to be vigilant in our efforts to protect our online reputations. This democratization of the media landscape is a good thing - it allows for a greater diversity of voices and perspectives to be heard. However, it also comes with its own set of challenges. Because anyone can now publish their thoughts online, it can be difficult to sift through all the noise to find the quality content. But overall, the rise of digital media has been a positive development, giving us all a greater platform to share our ideas.

        <h5 class="bushead whiteType">Week 6 Process Post: What shapes your experience of a text?</h5>
        <p class="bushead whiteType">An author can use different types of evidence to support their thesis. Authors may use scientific research, call on experts in a field, consult statistics, historical events, current events, analogies, and personal anecdotes to advance their argument or position through writing. The stronger the evidence, the more clearly readers will consider the point. However, written content is not the only way that publishers shape how audience engage with content. It is important for the publisher to identify the characteristics, interests, and expectations of their readers before deciding how to position the text. 
       <br>
       <br>
       In the first encounter with a published product, the publisher is relying on the design and marketing for the text to entice a potential reader. Before picking a book from a display, the end to end experience begins potential weeks prior as a customer feels that they may want to purchase a new book. Often, this is prompted through print marketing in the physical world or digital marketing online and through social media. In the coming days, the prospective customer may find themselves near a store that sells books. Here, the overall brand of the book retailer is important in providing a context where the customer is likely to confirm a purchase. Design aspects that are important at this stage include architecture, facade, and interior design. A publisher may have some influence here, if they are able to display posters on the facade or other print materials stitched into the well refined interior design of a successful book store. Next, a customer may identify a text from the spine or cover that is visible from the book as it sits on a shelf. Design affects the look, feel, and accessibility of a text. Design creates visual pathways that emphasize and amplify content. Design elements must have meaning and must never be "designed" randomly to attract attention. Every element on a page should have a clear and identifiable purpose, have a logical semantic relationship with other page elements, and make the content engaging and easy to read and understand. The design creates visual logic and seeks the best balance between visual experience and graphic information. Without the visual impact of shape, colour, and contrast, a page is graphically uninteresting and engaging to an audience. Dense text documents without contrast and visual relief can also be difficult to read, especially on smaller or relatively low-resolution screens. However, without the depth and complexity of text, highly graphical pages can frustrate users by failing to provide a balance between visual perception, textual information, and interaction. Graphic design has its roots in language and is still essentially typography, which is a way of expressing spoken language in printed matter.

        <h5 class="bushead black">Week 5 Process Post: How the role of an editor has changed from the 19th to the 20th century.</h5>
        <p class="bushead black">For centuries, the primary role of editors has been to connect authors to readers by deciding what to publish. This role was once called gatekeeping. Stories that editors allow to pass through metaphorical “gates” can influence what readers perceive as important -what scholars call agenda setting. Editors don't just influence which stories are told; they also shape how a story is told through word choice, story arrangement, example choice, photos, and most importantly, titles. Combined, an editors efforts can be called framing. Historians and biographers have written a lot about editors as individuals—their publications, their editorial instincts, their confrontations with powerful politicians, and their quest for truth, entertainment, profit, and influence. But as the media ecosystem shifts, there is less emphasis on broader changes affecting editorial work. Cultural and social changes place new demands on editors, who must adapt to keep up with audience tastes and expectations. Technological inventions and the disruption of old economic models forced editors to adapt to new media of mass communication, to serve new audiences and new financial realities. In short, broader economic, political, technological, and social changes have shaped which types of editorial staff thrive and which practices become obsolete. 
        </p><br><br>
        <p class="bushead black">In 1974, James Carey published "The Problem of Journalism History," an essay that quickly became well known in the professional world. The ideas and arguments Carey advanced remain the subject of research and debate. He writes: "The central and as yet unknown history of journalism is the history of the idea of ​​reporting: its emergence as an idealized reality among certain populations, its changing fortunes, its definitions, and its evolution over time. Redefining over time.” This article attempts to provide a conceptual history of reporting in the United States from 1885 to 1910. It examines how producers and observers of the American print market in the late 19th and early 20th centuries reported on their understanding of a proper world and how social forces and cultural values ​​shaped that understanding from 1885 to 1910. Today, the Internet has become an existential threat to editors as gatekeepers. </p>
        <br><br>
        <p class="bushead black">Countless new doors have opened connecting readers and writers, some with little editorial oversight. This is far from the first time editors have been forced to adapt to change, the story of editors has always been one of innovation - constantly finding new ways to connect readers and writers. Today, despite the declining power of gatekeepers, professional editors still play a vital role – culling high-quality content from the multitude of voices online and keeping it from being easily overlooked on social media and news sites, maintaining accuracy and authenticity. Whether approving, (or rejecting) investigative topics, editing prose, fact-checking articles, setting up website homepages, managing a newsroom, or deciding which journalists to hire, editors play a vital role in shaping the information shared with the press role audience.</p>

        <h5 class="bushead whiteType">Week 3 Process Post: Responding to Craig Mod about “How I Got My Attention Back”.</h5>
        <p class="bushead whiteType">“How I Got My Attention Back”, is a blog article by Craig Mod that sees the author endulging in a camp for artists offered by Virginia Center for Creative Arts for 30 days. Historically, ‘artist colonies’ are for privilidged white people who alchohol, affairs, and a hipster or hedonistic style of life. Craig agknowledges his privilidge in being able to attend the camp, describing the nature of this action as apostasy or paganism. Yet, Craig revels in his privilidge to do so.
<br><br>
            Craig Mod mistakes a cushy 30 day vacation for a onerous and life affecting period of self challenge and improvement. We are all easily able to quit addictions without harmful withdrawls for 30 days on a vacation. Just as easily, we will pick our habits back up after the end of the 30 day vacation and continue as if the context of our life had never changed. The truth is, Craig only vacationed for a brief period - despite 30 days being almost too long to even call a vacation. 
            <br><br>
            I hoped to find insight in the rules Craig Mod set for himself after his 30 day offline excursion. Unfortunately, his rules dont help my scenario. Craigs first rule states “The internet goes off before bed”. Unlike Craig, I do not spend time scrolling on my phone in bed. I stay in my living room until 3am and then get in bed and fall asleep. Craigs second rule states “The internet doesn’t return until after lunch.”. Craig spends time on his phone in the morning. I sleep until noon.
            <br><br>
            Conversely to Craig Mod, I highly appreciate giving my attention to my phone and other online devices. Craig seeks to be in control of his attention, while misunderstanding that appreciating human media, arts, comedy, people, culture, and fashion are perfectly good ways to spend attention. Clash of Clans however is entirely undeserving of any attention unless you are a farmer in Myanmar without access to personal computer gaming.

          <p class="bushead whiteType">To host this blog, I took an alternate approach from Word Press. Instead, I decided to code the site myself and host it on Github pages. Coming from a background in Simon Fraser University’s interactive arts and technology program, I have a history of working with cascading style sheets (CSS) and HTML to create digital products suited to publishing content on the web. In the past I have felt restricted with the capabilities of Wordpress, and for this course I felt that taking on the challenge of developing my own website would allow the overall brand and feel of my blog to be more controlled and specific to my vision. Github Pages is a free web hosting platform that provides all the powerful features of the GitHub software. It allows for image and video hosting, JavaScript, and all other forms of digital product creation. I began by drafting up an HTML index file with a loose content hierarchy structure with the general scope of assignments in mind. Knowing that I would need to replicate a blog, I sought to provide headings that include date and titles. I also sought to create clear hierarchy between each post by changing the background colour from blog post to blog post. To meet accessibility guidelines, I leveraged a powerful CSS sheet that keeps elements accessible on all modern and older desktop devices. <br><br> My next step was to develop a unique and identifiable brand to personify the voice of my blog and written content. I began by selecting imagery that represented my tastes in fashion and design. Leveraging photography created in collaboration with fashion designer Rick Owens, I drafted a dark and classy mood-board that emphasized a mysterious and fashionable atmosphere. Knowing that the blog would be focused on Haute Coture, my goal was to create a polished brand that exudes an avant garde take on luxury.  Next, I began to select typography. I knew that this was an opportunity to select a serif font that would appear professional and classic. While I browsed through many modern display serif fonts, I ultimately selected two of the most classic type faces to represent my blog. Century Expanded and Helvetica are two type faces among three other type faces chosen by the great designer Massimo Vignelli as the most important fonts of our time. The elegance and stature of Century Expanded provide my blog with the exact feeling I aimed to evoke. Helvetica is the greatest typographic achievement in the English language, and I often default to it for a professional and timeless look. Lastly, I began to ideate names for the blog. ‘Moda’ is the word for ‘fashion’ in Italian. I selected this title for its brevity and shape.</p>

          <h5 class="bushead black">Week 2 Process Post Continued: What constitutes a stranger?</h5>
          <h5 class="bushead black"></h5>
         <p class="bushead black"> I consider a person known when I have had a handful of interactions with them. Often I know who people are though social media without having ever spoken to them. Often I know very much about people without ever having seen them! This is due to social media reccomending me people to follow, or showcasing accounts of local people who follow similar pages as me. To me, a person can be a stranger depending on context. Any random person who I have never seen or heard of is certainly a stranger. An aquaintance may also be a stranger to me if they are in a more personal setting. I will typically address an aquaintance somewhat more casually than a stranger. The intination and pitch of my voice may also be lower or higher depending on how I want to convey myself to the stranger. For example, if the stranger is an employer, someone elderly, or someone young, I will speak softer and choose my phrasing carefully. <br><br>If I were to meet a friend who I knew online in person, I would initially retain my careful selection of phrasing. Being the stranger is an ‘emotionally risky’ endevour. In a situation where I am the stranger, it takes repeated interaction over a longer period of time before I feel that I know indivuduals.</p>

         <h5 class="bushead black">Week 1 Process Post: Meeting a Stranger.</h5>
         <h5 class="bushead black"></h5>
        <p class="bushead black">This week I spoke with a stranger. I was practicing my recreational hobby - skateboarding at a park on commercial drive. This time, I visited a park that I do not typically frequent. I consider a person known when I have had a handful of interactions with them. When the stranger arrived at the park, we exchanged a nod. After a brief period of time, I crossed the threshold and asked a question. James Hamblin observes that 
  <br><br>
            “When it comes to knowing people, that line is still often drawn at whether you’ve spoken to a person before...A significant threshold to be crossed with a simple act” .
            <br>
            <br>
            Hamblin’s musing was correct in this case. When I returned to the park on subsequent days, I continued to meet and talk with the stranger. I have now met them three times, and we exchanged names. Often, the skatepark is ripe with civil inattention. Due to the smaller sizer of this park and fewer number of people, it was easier to speak to a stranger. The encounter was very different from my online interactions, as I am a heavy emoji user. There were also periodic breaks as we exercised.</p>
