        <h5 class="bushead black">Essay One: Fake News in the world of Fashion</h5>
        <p class="bushead black">Social media has introduced the millennial audience to the once closely guarded world of high fashion, with publications like Hypebeast delivering media coverage to 7.1 million young followers. As one of them, I use Instagram to keep up to date on the forefront of fashion labels and brands. The concept of fake news has been an influential factor in all forms of media long before the term has recently come to prominence in the global view. Hoaxes, embellishments, and lying through marketing has consisted in some form through fashion marketing media since its inception. Scrolling through my instagram feed I came across Shudu, an up and coming model. After a feature on American singer Rihanna's eponymous cosmetics brand ‘Fenty’, Shudu’s instagram is now at 159,000 followers and growing. Achieving the role is no small accomplishment for Shudu, as the fashion modeling industry is difficult to succeed in for a person of colour. Editor in Chief at Teen Vogue, Lindsay Peoples Wagner, notes that “Less than 10 percent of the 146 fashion designers who showed at the major fall 2018 shows for New York Fashion Week were black, and only 1,173 black models out of 7,608 model castings walked.” (Wagner, 2018). Yet with Shudu’s fashion ideal facial structure, her success is unsurprising. Shudu’s facial symmetry, high cheekbones, and clear skin give her a flawless appearance. <br><br>Months after discovering Shudu, I would see her again leading the fall season fashion campaign for French label Balmain. In the weeks following, my newsfeed was filled with an abundance of articles debating the campaign. Shudu’s appearance is not due to luck or rigorous dieting. Created by computer-generated imagery (CGI) artist Cameron James Wilson, Shudu is a digital rendering.
        <br><br>Months after discovering Shudu, I would see her again leading the fall season fashion campaign for French label Balmain. In the weeks following, my newsfeed was filled with an abundance of articles debating the campaign. Shudu’s appearance is not due to luck or rigorous dieting. Created by computer-generated imagery (CGI) artist Cameron James Wilson, Shudu is a digital rendering. 
        Unsurprisingly, I was not the only one fooled by Shudu. In the comments beneath her images on Instagram, her fans hotly debate and question her reality. In an article for Vice magazine, fashion reporter Hannah Ongley observed the transparency of CGI models online. She stated that “avatar Instagram models thrive on a degree of deceit, or at least ambiguity. “Making it” requires compelling fans to have heated comment feuds about the physical existence of the person they’re following.” (Ongley, 2018). With the recent US election, fake news has shown how easy it is for public opinion to be swayed by falsified stories and images. As a creator who is publishing content within the world of fashion on the internet, I understand the importance of promoting visibility for a diverse array of people and body types. If the fashion world already had problems with casting largely white people with unattainably thin bodies, then CGI models present an even worse situation. For CGI models, the inherent suffering required to maintain perfect skin and physique is erased - yet they still promote unachievable body image ideals. If I were to create a CGI representation for my online self, I would likely try to make myself appear as perfect and ideal as possible.

        Preceding the launch of autumn’s 2018 Balmain Campaign, the French luxury fashion house would preview their new clothing line rendered on digital models. Including Shudu and two others, the CGI models are nearly indistinguishable from the actual women whose makeup and post production already give them an otherworldly appearance. Louis Vuitton’s 2013 campaign saw the brand collaborating with famous CGI vocal idol Hatsune Miku. Three years later Louis Vuitton would again collaborate with a famous Japanese CGI model, Claire ‘Lightning’ Farron, from the Final Fantasy video game series. The well known characters are rendered in their respective art styles, creating an interesting intersection between Louis Vuitton’s haute couture and their fantasy worlds. Miku and Farron are great examples of how CGI models should be, unmistakably CGI.

        CGI artist behind Shudu and Dagny, Cameron James Wilson, denies that the CGI models push beauty standards any further than the human models do. He counters the notion in an interview with social media focused publication WERSM, stating that “I think we’re at a place now where real people are so filtered, so photoshopped, that there is no actual differentiation between 3D art and a photo. You’ll see more natural imperfections on Shudu’s page than your average influencer.” (Wilson 2018) Wilson also recognizes the importance of transparency when it comes to the questionable reality of the models. Cameron James Wilson stated “When I realized that people were no longer questioning Shudu’s existence and had almost accepted that she was a real person I decided to be very transparent.” (Wilson, 2018). This statement was released after significant backlash on twitter as fans of Balmain discovered Shudu.
        <br><br>
        While Balmain debut their CGI campaign, the same fall 2018 season saw Italian luxury fashion house Prada hold a show with CGI model Miquela Sousa in Milan. Sporting a mix of Prada’s ss18 and fw18 gear, Miquela took over the Prada instagram guiding viewers through the venue. Podcast co-host Rachel Arthur dedicated an episode of ‘The Current’ to the viability of CGI models. Arthur accounted that after the Prada show, data analysis platform Launchmetrics was used to measure Prada’s influencer initiatives in terms of monetary value (Arthur, 2018). Surprisingly, an average Miquela Prada post generated 13, 000 euros in revenue, whereas posts from actual influencers garnered over 100, 000. Assuredly it would seem cheaper to use a digital model rather than paying an actual one, however this is not true. For now, the technology is not cheap. Arthur determined that, “Using a CGI model drives significantly less engagement for brands than a human influencer does.” Brands like Balmain are paying - and losing, to be innovative. It is for a creative decision, not a business decision, that brands are choosing to use CGI models. Yet if Shudu and Dagny appear indistinguishable from actual human models, then they no longer fulfill any artistic purpose. Rather, Balmain’s embrace of technology truly replaces real human models. Computer generated imagery presents an interesting new way for luxury fashion houses to art direct their work, yet without their digital context, they pose a very real problem to the fashion industry and its audiences by taking roles from struggling models and pushing beauty standards to an unreal extreme.
