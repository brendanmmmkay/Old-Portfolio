        <h5 class="bushead black">Essay One: How Social media communities seeking to uphold free speech allow fake news.</h5>
        <p class="bushead black">The world wide web has created spaces for all voices with internet access to be heard, however the democracy of the online world is properly tenuous on mainstream social media platforms including twitter and youtube for those who have a wide reaching audience and who share content that incites hatered and violence. In the offices of each social media giant, dedicated teams are working to remove hate speech and contentious content on a massive scale. Many digital products have artifical intelligence programs that scrape their platforms seeking to remove anything that matches their censorship content filters, allowing social media giants to have some automatic control over the vast sea of content that they are responsible for controlling. Professor of psychology at Rider University in Buffalo New Jersey is a reknown writer on the behaviour of people online. <br><br>Months after discovering Shudu, I would see her again leading the fall season fashion campaign for French label Balmain. In the weeks following, my newsfeed was filled with an abundance of articles debating the campaign. Shudu’s appearance is not due to luck or rigorous dieting. Created by computer-generated imagery (CGI) artist Cameron James Wilson, Shudu is a digital rendering. 
        Unsurprisingly, I was not the only one fooled by Shudu. In the comments beneath her images on Instagram, her fans hotly debate and question her reality. In an article for Vice magazine, fashion reporter Hannah Ongley observed the transparency of CGI models online. She stated that “avatar Instagram models thrive on a degree of deceit, or at least ambiguity. “Making it” requires compelling fans to have heated comment feuds about the physical existence of the person they’re following.” (Ongley, 2018). With the recent US election, fake news has shown how easy it is for public opinion to be swayed by falsified stories and images. As a creator who is publishing content within the world of fashion on the internet, I understand the importance of promoting visibility for a diverse array of people and body types. If the fashion world already had problems with casting largely white people with unattainably thin bodies, then CGI models present an even worse situation. For CGI models, the inherent suffering required to maintain perfect skin and physique is erased - yet they still promote unachievable body image ideals. If I were to create a CGI representation for my online self, I would likely try to make myself appear as perfect and ideal as possible.

        Many social media platforms have different ways of disseminating information, particularly in content feeds that decide what users will see first. Popular American social news aggregator Reddit is a social media platform that is known for its echo chamber nature. User submitted entries on Reddit are voted down or up toward the top of the content feed. On the Reddit front page, the posts that have accumulated the highest amout of votes are shown. Like any website, most user traffic begins and ends on the front page. Only Reddit users who have created accounts are able to vote. This means that only a minute percentage of Reddit viewers are active users with accounts who vote on posts. The community of active Redditors promote an echo chamber culture that is often dubbed as a ‘hive mind’. While the hive mind generally promotes liberal ideals and progressive thinking, it can also be harmful. In the aftermath of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, Reddit users created a Reddit page dedicated to crowdsourcing information on possible suspects. In efforts to identify the culprits, Redditors misidentified a Boston University Student, influencing the local authorities and news sources to place this student as the primary suspect. This led to the student comitting suicide in the days following. In this case of internet vigilantism, outside news sources and overly invested redditors caused a real local influence with serious repercussions that harshly worsened a students challenges with mental health. Misinformation and disinformation lead to Redditors staging a public online shaming full of slander, racism, and threats of more violence. While some Redditors felt their actions were helping Boston find closure in the wake of a tragedy, others leveraged the opportunity to spew vitriol and hatred toward anyone who fit their racist preconceptions.

         Democratic platforms that promote free speech must still stand against hate speech. Twitter stands for free speech above all other popular social media platforms. While Google, YouTube, Facebook and Apple banned some of popular far right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones’ content, Twitter lagged and waited. In 2018 on the official Twitter blog, VP of Trust and Safety Del Harvey posted an article discussing Twitter rules. Rules on Twitter are meant to exist as a living document that is commonly updated as new events unfold. Harvey (2018) states that “Twitter is reflective of real conversations happening in the world and that sometimes includes perspectives that may be offensive, controversial, and/or bigoted.” Harvey continued to discuss how Twitter seeks to prohibit offensive and bigoted content that uses fear to silence the voices of other twitter users.

        Following the January 6 United States Capitol attack instigated by 45th president Donald J Trump, Twitter permanently suspended his account, @realDonaldTrump. Senioir reporter at Tech Crunch, Taylor Hatmaker, discussed the policy decision making at Twitter. Hatmaker (2021) states, “In reality, Twitter gave Trump many, many second chances over his four years as president, keeping him on the platform due to the company’s belief that speech by world leaders is in the public interest, even if it breaks the rules”.
        <br><br>
        Many Twitter users called for the suspension of Donald Trump’s account long before the social media platform decided to bring down the hammer. In the case of Donald Trump, updates from the American president are surely in the public interest. In a new official Twitter blog update that was promptly posted as America dealt with the aftermath of the capitol attack, a transparent, comprehensive, and detailed analysis for the decision behind banning Donald Trump was shared. Most importantly, Twitter’s living Trust and Safety document was assesed with the verdict being that Donald Trump’s tweets violated Twitter’s glorification of violence policy.
